What sorts of sentences can it parse?

There are 3 main type of structure can be parsed. The first one is NP+VP, this mainly stands for sb/sth does sth.
The second one is faux+np+vp, which mainly stands for question sentence, such as 'Does he live in Chicago'?  
The third one is np+fis+np, which stands for predictive sentence, like he is allien.

What types of sentences will it fail to parse?

Firstly, this parser can only accpet the sentense consisting of the words in grammer corpus, that means a sentence including
the novel words can not be parsed.
Apparently, imperative snetence(starting with single verb) and all kinds of clauses(attributive clause) can not be parsed. 
Compound sentense can not be parsed since there is no coordinated conjunctions.
Perfect tense can not be parsed neither, since there is no have/had.

What improvements to the grammar or parser are required to properly parse common failed sentences?

we can expand the corpus and vocabulary, and add more grammar such as coordinated conjunctions and attributive clause.
