First, I add coordinate conjuctions as folowing:
s	s cc s
0  (They gamble, and they smoke), this can present two parallel sentence, to concatenate them.
np	np cc np
0 (john and Marry), this mainly stands for coordinate two subjects or objects
vp	vp cc vp
0 (sing and dance), this mainly stands for coordinate two verbs
cc	and
0	cc	but
0	cc	or
0	cc	so


 ,these are coordinate conjuctions(and, but, or, so)

Then I add imperative sentence:
s	vp0  (Pour the trash.), this typically starts with a verb phrase.

Other improvements like:
s	np fis pp
0	s	fis np pp
0, this could parse some sentences like "he is in chicago", "is he in chicago?
The most common invalid sentences that can be parsed would be:
"i is in chicago", "you is on planet"
